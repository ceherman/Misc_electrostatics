# Electrostatics codes and retention factor data

This repository contains IEX retention factor data that were generated in-house as well as attempts to reproduce those data from first principles using colloidal electrostatics models.

Code for the non-singular boundary integral method (NS-BIM) was generously provided by Q. Sun & D. Y. C. Chan; please cite
